# Adversarial Machine Learning Project
With machine learning being used in a wide variety of areas, the security and reliability of them are becoming more and more important. The goal of this project is to show that some of the most used models can be easily attacked. Specifically, we will find some good models used in predictive policing and demonstrate how to attack them to produce inaccurate results.
